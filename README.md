# Tennis
## Description
This Kata goal is to implement a simple tennis score computer.

The scoring system consist in one game, divided by points :
Each player starts a game with 0 point.
- If the player wins the 1st ball, he will have 15 points. 2nd balls won : 30 points. 3rd ball won : 40points.
- If a player have 40 points and wins the ball, he wins the game, however there are special rules.
  - If both players have 40 points the players are “deuce”.
  - If the game is in deuce, the winner of the ball will have advantage
  - If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game
  - If the player without advantage wins the ball they are back at “deuce”.

You can found more details about the rules here : ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#Scoring )

Here we want you to develop a java method that will take a String as input containing the character ‘A’ or ‘B’. The character ‘A’ corresponding to “player A won the ball”, and ‘B’ corresponding to “player B won the ball”. The java method should print the score after each won ball (for example : “Player A : 15 / Player B : 30”) and print the winner of the game.

For example the following input “ABABAA” should print :

“Player A : 15 / Player B : 0”

“Player A : 15 / Player B : 15”

“Player A : 30 / Player B : 15”

“Player A : 30 / Player B : 30”

“Player A : 40 / Player B : 30”

“Player A wins the game
